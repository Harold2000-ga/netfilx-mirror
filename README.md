<h1>Netflix MirrorðŸš€</h1>

<p>This project is a design of a movie website that displays upcoming movies, as well as
            the most anticipated, popular, and highly-rated movies. It also includes a filter to
            view movies by genre. The website requires authentication, which is implemented using
            Firebase</p>
